Another way of creating a Dashboard is by copying or duplicating an existing Dashboard. In the sidebar, to the left, you will see a **Create New** button at the bottom of the Dashboards section. You can click on it to create a new Dashboard or a copy of an existing Dashboard. For duplicating an existing Dashboard, you will have to select the option **Copy Existing Dashboard** and then select the Dashboard you wish to copy from the drop-down list. You can also search by name, which is especially useful if you have many Dashboards.

You must select a Profile to which the new Dashboard will be linked, give it a name and, if you wish, give it a description. After that is done, you can click **Add** to create the new Dashboard.
