- **Delete Dashboards**: If the user created a Dashboard, they can delete it. Previously only the Designer had the power to delete Dashboards.

## Dashboard Hierarchy

Dashboards in V6 are no longer isolated objects but can exist within a hierarchy. This allows dashboards to be associated with specific groups or sites, improving navigation and organization. For example:

- Dashboards can belong to a specific region or site.
- Users can access dashboards relevant to their context without excessive scrolling or searching.

## Editing in Context

In v6, you can edit a Dashboard while still seeing its contents.

## KPI Positioning in Different Sizes

you can set up things to be in the same container, so that when the size of the screen goes down, specific things remain together.
