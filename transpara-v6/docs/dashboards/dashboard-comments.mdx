You can add a comment to anything in a Dashboard. That includes any Object inside the Dashboard, as well as the Dashboard itself. These comments will be on a thread and anyone with access can respond.

For example, if there are 3 KPIs in the red, you can add a comment directly on the Dashboard asking "Why are those on the red this morning?"
