**OLD TEXT, USED AS A HOLDER**

On this page, we describe the different Transpara user types and options available for them. From this page, we define the paths of specific content each user should cover to optimize their time and learning curve, focusing on what you need to accomplish your goals.

## Transpara User Types

The Transpara documentation aims to provide content in a tailored way for three user types:

- **Administrator**: Administrators usually are from the IT team. They're responsible for the Transpara integration, covering the system preparation and installation. Administrators create or use existing interfaces to connect data sources to Transpara. In addition, if your company already has KPIs, the Administrator can use the automation tools provided by Transpara to import these KPIs into Transpara automatically.

- **Designer**: The Designer manages the Transpara configuration, preparing the system for end users to consume the data. They use the Transpara Designer tool, a versatile Excel-based solution, to set up the system's appearance and behavior. The Designer is responsible for creating visualization objects, such as KPIs, Charts, and Tables, and organizing them into Groups.

- **End-User**: The End-users of Transpara are the individuals who use the software to access data, reports, and insights. They consume the data available on Transpara after the integration from the Administrator and customization from the Designer. End-users don't necessarily require extensive technical knowledge to use Transpara. They're responsible for analyzing the available data.

## Documentation Structure

It is important to note that the documentation for Transpara is organized to serve the three types of users - each with its own section and specific content to assist them in using the available tools. However, we suggest starting with the [Transpara Core Concepts](/docs/core-concepts) to gain a general understanding of the platform's functionality.

After reading the core concepts, each user can continue to their specific section:

- [Setup and Administration](/docs/setup-and-administration): This section was planned to help the Administrator install Transpara, create and start using interfaces, and show how to use the automation functionalities to import existing KPIs from your system into Transpara.
- [Transpara Design](/docs/visual-kpi-designer/overview): Designers find in this section the necessary content to configure Transpara and create KPIs, Charts, Tables, and Groups.
- [End User](/docs/end-user/overview): The guide for end users to learn how to use and take advantage of Transpara is available in this section.

In addition to these tailored sections, Transpara documentation provides support pages to cover specific needs, where you can find:

- [Reference guides](/docs/references): These provide detailed documentation and information for users to refer to when they need in-depth knowledge or assistance regarding specific Transpara functionalities.

- [Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)](/docs/faqs): This section contains answers to common questions and issues that users may encounter while using Transpara, offering quick solutions.

- [Training materials](/docs/training): Include training video courses and other materials designed to educate users on effectively using Transpara and its features.

- [Glossary](/docs/glossary): Explore a list of key terms and their definitions to clarify technical jargon and terminology used within Transpara.
