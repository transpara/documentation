**OLD TEXT, USED AS A HOLDER**

In this section, you can learn the essential ideas to become a pro at using Transpara. These concepts lay the groundwork for a better understanding of the software, making it easier to get started.

## Main concepts 

- **[KPI (Key Performance Indicators)](./core-concepts/kpi)**: KPIs are metrics used to measure the performance of critical activities. They represent specific data points or indicators indispensable for tracking and evaluating how well an organization is meeting its goals. KPIs are essential tools for decision-makers, providing insights into performance trends and guiding strategic adjustments based on real-time data.

- **[Hierarchy/Groups](./core-concepts/hierarchy)**: Hierarchy and Groups are different ways of referring to Transpara's organization model. Hierarchy is basically a system of Groups that allows you to organize and categorize your KPIs, similar to your computer's folders. The Groups visualization shows data in various colors, indicating the KPIs' status and allowing easy data visualization.

- **[Design and authoring](./core-concepts/design)**: This part of Transpara involves configuring key objects like Groups, KPIs, Charts, and Tables. Transpara Designer, an Excel-based tool, is versatile and suitable for tasks ranging from prototypes to large-scale systems. The KPI design process covers Basics, User Experience, SPC, Extended, and Access Group List sections. Administrators manage links for user accessibility, ensuring vital resources are easily reachable.

- **[Data Sources](./core-concepts/data-sources)**: In Transpara, "Data Sources" refers to the locations and origins of data that the system accesses and uses for various functions. Understanding data sources is crucial as it ensures the practicality and feasibility of requested interfaces. Moreover, a data source serves as the point from which the software collects and integrates data. This knowledge is essential for effectively integrating data into the Transpara system.

-  **[Interfaces](./core-concepts/interfaces)**:  Interfaces in Transpara are how the software retrieves data from external systems. These interfaces are always read-only, meaning they can fetch data but not alter it. Users can ensure smooth data flow into the KPI system by selecting the right interface, enhancing functionality, and providing accurate information for informed decision-making.

-  **[Access Levels](./core-concepts/access-level)**: Access levels in the context of KPI systems refer to the permissions and restrictions applied to users or roles within the system. Access levels determine what users can see and do within the KPI system, ensuring data security and integrity, efficiency, usability, and compliance.
