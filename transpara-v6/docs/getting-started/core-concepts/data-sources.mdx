**OLD TEXT, USED AS A HOLDER**

The data presented on Transpara doesn't require a dedicated storage system. Transpara doesn't require you to move your data from the server or cloud system you are currently using. Transpara will consider all systems used by your company as data sources from which to retrieve information. Rather than migrating data into a new centralized repository, Transpara communicates with these diverse sources, eliminating the need for data duplication and making management more straightforward.

This enables Transpara to access near real-time data, providing up-to-the-minute information with added context, color, status indicators, and meaningful insights. By interfacing with different data sources, Transpara ensures you're always working with the latest data without the hassle of manual updates or migration.

## Types of data sources

Transpara provides comprehensive support for various data source types, requiring specialized [interfaces](./interfaces) for each source. These data sources can be categorized into several classes. A summary of the many data sources available for integration with Transpara is listed below: 

- **Industrial and enterprise historians**, like OSIsoft PI, GE Proficy, Rockwell, Honeywell, and more.
- **Relational databases**, such as Microsoft SQL Server, Oracle, MySQL, and Access.
- **External web services**, which may provide data like weather conditions, market pricing, and supplier information through an API.
- **Manual data entries** via Excel, form applications, or directly within Transpara.
- **Business applications**, including ERP, CRM, and specialized industry software.
- **Data obtained from devices** like sensors, IoT, IIoT, and control systems (DCS/PLC).

Transpara continuously interacts with data sources, ensuring a near real-time experience and eliminating the need for manual page-refreshing to access the most current data.

## Data sources requirements

Different data sources may require different processes to integrate with Transpara and recover data in real time. This involves understanding whether data must be retrieved from external systems or databases. However, the Transpara team is always ready to assist you. If you use a database different from those listed above, don't worry, the Transpara team can adapt it to ensure it works seamlessly with Transpara.
