**OLD TEXT, USED AS A HOLDER**

At the core of Transpara is its ability to effortlessly integrate with your existing operations. Transpara's flexibility is one of its defining features. In addition to supporting thousands of data sources, it provides customizable deployment options and security functionalities to cover all industries and businesses.

## Where Transpara Software Lives

Many new users assume that Transpara software operates in the cloud, such as a SaaS, and that customer data will be hosted externally. However, this isn't the case.

First, Transpara doesn't require moving any data to new databases. It reads your data in near-real-time from wherever you keep it and uses it without requiring you to manage and maintain a new master data source.

Regarding the Transpara deployment, you can choose the option that best suits your business needs. You can integrate Transpara software inside your environment using one of the following options:

- **In Your Cloud**: Transpara can be hosted in your cloud environment, providing the convenience of cloud-based deployment.

- **On Your Server**: Alternatively, you can run Transpara on your server, giving you complete control over your operations and ensuring the data will stay within your organization.

Transpara understands that each customer and each application may require a different deployment approach, and we're open to customizing it and aligning it to your unique needs.

## Security Integration

Transpara efficiently integrates with your existing security model. Transpara understands that only you thoroughly understand your security requirements, so we make our solution fully customizable at all levels. When using Transpara, you can:

- Set up permissions for your Transpara websites to limit who can view your KPI data.
- Create local groups and users to specify who can access each KPI collection.
- Use object-level security to restrict access to specific objects within Transpara, such as KPIs, Charts, Tables, or Groups.
- Define permissions for the Transpara Designer to limit who can modify your KPI configurations.

Transpara is a Web server-based application. As a result, it takes advantage of existing authentication and rights-assignment subsystems within the platform, including the directory and all related security policies. In addition, Transpara makes sharing real-time information easy and secure. It shares links rather than data, ensuring that sensitive information doesn't fall into the wrong hands.

To learn more about security in Transpara, access the [Security](./core-concepts/access-level) page in the documentation or the [security articles list](https://www.transpara.com/article-categories/security/) in the knowledge base.
