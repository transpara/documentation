tCalc is a robust calculation engine designed for flexible and scalable data processing. This guide will walk you through the process of using tCalc, from connecting databases to defining and evaluating calculations.

Some sections are placeholders for information that will be added as the project progresses.

## Connecting to Databases to Import Data

tCalc allows you to import data from multiple sources. Data can originate from graph databases like tGraph, relational databases, or other defined interfaces. Attributes in the system may be **static** or **dynamic**, with dynamic attributes fetching real-time data via defined lookups.

### Steps to Connect a Database:

1. Navigate to the **Interfaces** section in tCalc.
2. Define the endpoint for the data source.
3. Use the **lookup feature** to specify the attribute you want to retrieve (e.g., selecting a column from an SQL table or a tag from a time-series database).

More details on database integration will be added here as they are finalized.

## Creating a Template

Templates are predefined configurations for calculations that streamline the setup process. They allow consistent behavior across multiple objects.

### Steps to Create a Template:

1. Go to the **Templates** section.
2. Select the template type (e.g., KPI template, Metric template).
3. Define input attributes (e.g., attributes from the parent, child, or sibling objects in the hierarchy).
4. Specify triggers, such as event-based or interval-based calculations.

## Defining Statements

Statements in tCalc define the core logic of a calculation. They are executed sequentially, with outputs from one statement often serving as inputs for the next.

### Programming Language for Statements

tCalc supports predefined functions and operations that can be dynamically inserted via the interface. Users can drag-and-drop functions to build statements.

### How to Define Statements

1. Start by selecting a template or creating a new calculation.
2. Input variables will appear automatically based on the target object.
3. Use the editor to define your statement logic. For example, `Status = CalculateStatus(ActualValue, Threshold)`
5. Save and evaluate the statements in real time to test results.

## Connecting to Databases to Export Results

After calculating, tCalc can export results to the same or other data sources. Export configurations define the destination and format of the output.

### Steps to Export Results

1. Configure the export interface in the **Interfaces** section.
2. Map the output attributes from the calculation to the corresponding fields in the target system.
3. Test the export setup using the evaluation feature to verify data accuracy.

## Using the Template

Templates simplify the reuse of calculations across multiple objects.

### Applying a Template

1. Select a target object (e.g., a substation, district, or KPI).
2. Choose an existing template and instantiate it for the object.
3. Modify parameters if needed, or activate the template version for immediate use.

### Versioning

Templates support multiple versions. You can save changes as a new version and activate them when ready. Existing calculations tied to the template will update automatically upon activation.
