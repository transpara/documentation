## Stale Age

The Stale Age is a certain amount of time, after which the KPI will show in orange. That means that the data in that KPI was received a while ago, so that information might not be as relevant anymore, or the data source might be disconnected.

The Stale Age default configuration is 14400 minutes (10 days), but you should set it up so it matches your situation. If you receive data every hour, for example, you might want to set your stale age to a few hours. If you have many KPIs that constantly go stale, consider reviewing your stale age limit.

:::tip Stale Age Alert

Consider setting up an alert for your admin about stale KPIs so that they can check if everything is working as expected or if there is a need to fix some data input or examine that KPI's source.

:::

To alter the Stale Age sitewide configuration, click on the Site Settings icon (<PngFont name='options28' />), go to **Features & Config**, select **Website** settings, scroll to the **KPI Settings** section and change the number in the **Value** column. This number should be in minutes and if you leave it as 0 (zero), the website will ignore the Stale status. This feature can be overridden by individual KPI's settings.
