Some features will help you use Visual KPI Designer by creating a better experience for you and the End User.

## Preview

In the [UI Tour](/docs/visual-kpi-designer/interface-tour-and-core-patterns/ui-tour), we presented the Preview button (<PngFont name='preview28-2.fw' />). Here, we will explain it in more detail.

The Preview feature is very useful when filling a KPI with functions or if you wish to check whether the limits you established encompass the received data. When you turn it on, it will fill the sheet with the results that will appear on the Visual KPI site.
