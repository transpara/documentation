If you read through all the guides of the Visual KPI Designer, you will already have read about these features. However, here you will find more detailed information on how to use them to create a better experience for you and the End User.

## Preview

In the [UI Tour](/docs/visual-kpi-designer/ui-tour), we presented the Preview button (<PngFont name='preview28-2.fw' />). Here, we will explain it in more detail.

The Preview feature is very useful when filling a KPI with functions or if you wish to check whether the limits you established encompass the received data. When you turn it on, it will fill the sheet with the results that will appear on the Visual KPI site.

## Basic and Advanced columns

Another feature we presented in the [UI Tour](/docs/visual-kpi-designer/ui-tour) is the button to toggle Basic and Advanced modes of the worksheets (<PngFont name='advancedmode28gray' />). You can use this button to make your use of Visual KPI Designer easier.

Whenever using only the basic features of Visual KPI Designer, we recommend keeping this option deactivated. That way, your worksheets will have less columns to worry about. However, if you want to make certain customizations, you'll probably need to click the advanced mode button to see all possible columns.
