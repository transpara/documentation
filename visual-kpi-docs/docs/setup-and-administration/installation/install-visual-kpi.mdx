This guide outlines the steps to install and use Visual KPI Server Manager. After correctly installing our system, you will be ready to create your [**Interfaces**](/docs/setup-and-administration/interfaces) and take full advantage of Visual KPI.

## Installing Visual KPI Server Manager

Follow the steps described below to correctly set up Visual KPI Server Manager:

1. Access our [Downloads page](https://www.transpara.com/software-downloads/) and download **Visual KPI Server Manager**.
2. Execute the downloaded software.
3. Go through the installation wizard as required and install our system.
4. Open **Visual KPI Server Manager**.

If Visual KPI Server Manager fails to open, make sure all [prerequisites](/docs/setup-and-administration/installation/prepare-your-system) are met accurately.

As Visual KPI Server Manager opens, it will look like the picture below:

## Installing a Visual KPI Instance

Your next step to validate if everything works correctly is installing a Visual KPI Instance. You can choose to install it into a new Site, or at a existing one on the list showed on the server manager. Both will take you through the same process below:

1. Right-click on **Sites** or on an existing site listed inside **Sites**.
2. Select the **Install New Visual KPI Instance** option.
3. Go through the required steps of the installation wizard.
4. Accept the terms of the license agreement.
5. Add your **License Key**.
:::unique Valid License
A green checkmark will appear at the right side when a valid license is entered.
:::
6. Set your Website Settings and Instance Settings.
7. Choose the directory to install the new instance.
8. Define your Database Server, it can be a remote server or a local.
:::note
This is the Database Visual KPI uses for all it's configuration information, not a data source.
:::
9. Add your credentials to connect to the database. If you have your SQL login mapped to windows, you can use Windows authentication, otherwise you need to add your SQL login and password.
10. Add the administrator information. This is used to send alerts to the system administrator when the website requires attention.
11. Choose whether to install prebuilt demos and sample data.
12. Validate everything and install it.

Below you find a step-by-step of the process above:

### Validate if everything is OK

Once you have installed the new instance, you can validate if everything is working as expected. To do this:

1. Right-click the new created Instance.
2. Select the **Browse** option.

Your browser will open with a Visual KPI Website similar to this:
