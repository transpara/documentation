# Install a Virtual Machine with Hyper-V

For users that don't have access to a Windows Server, but still desire to try out Visual KPI Server Manager, we suggest installing a Virtual Machine using [Hyper-V on Windows](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualization/hyper-v-on-windows/about/). This page presents steps to enable virtualization, and using Hyper-V to install a new Windows Server VM.

Hyper-V specifically provides hardware virtualization. That means each virtual machine runs on virtual hardware. Hyper-V lets you create virtual hard drives, virtual switches, and a number of other virtual devices all of which can be added to virtual machines.

## Step 1: Enable virtualization on Windows

To enable virtualization, you need to make sure that your system supports it and has the necessary drivers installed. Access the following links for each Windows version and follow the steps to enable it:

      externalLink: true
    },

      externalLink: true
    },
  ]
}/>

:::info BIOS Configuration
In some cases, it is required to make changes in the UEFI (or BIOS) to enable virtualization on Windows. Access this [Windows support](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/enable-virtualization-on-windows-11-pcs-c5578302-6e43-4b4b-a449-8ced115f58e1) page for guidance.

Many Windows 10 PCs, and all PCs that come preinstalled with Windows 11, already have virtualization enabled. If yours are already enabled, you can skip this step.

## Step 2: Install a new Server Windows VM

With Hyper-V enabled you are ready to install a new Windows Server Virtual Machine. Follow the steps below to  create your first VM:

1. [Download a Evaluation ISO of Windows Server](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/evalcenter/evaluate-windows-server-2022).
2. Open  the **Hyper-V Manager** from the start menu.
3. Select **New** on the right sidebar, and choose the **Virtual Machine** option.
4. Follow the installation wizard:
    1. Give the new VM a name.
    2. Select **Generation 2** in the Specify Generation tab.
    3. Allocate memory to your VM. It's recommended to assign at least 2048 MB for a basic setup. More may be required depending on your server's role.
    4. Connect the VM to a virtual switch to ensure it has network connectivity.
    5. Choose to create a new virtual hard disk or use an existing one. Set the size according to your needs (for example, 127GB for a typical installation).
    6. Select **Install an operating system from a bootable image file** and then browse to select the Windows Server ISO file you downloaded.
    7. Review your settings. Click **Finish** to create the virtual machine.
5. Connect to your new virtual machine by right-clicking on its entry in the middle pane of Hyper-V window and selecting **Connect**.

When you first start your new VM, you will need to configure the initial  setup of your server. Follow the wizard as required by Windows.

## Step 3: Prepare your system for Visual KPI Server Manager

Once you finish the initial configurations, you'll have a new Windows environment to work on. Now you can go back to [Preparing your system for Visual KPI Server Manager](/docs/setup-and-administration/installation/prepare-your-system).
