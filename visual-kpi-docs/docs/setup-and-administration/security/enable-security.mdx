To secure your Visual KPI websites, data, and the Visual KPI Designer, you first need to enable security. Visual KPI supports any security model that uses IIS, such as VPN, RSA, and other two-factor authentication methods.

:::tip Save Time

Integrating the Visual KPI Server Manager with IIS saves you the time of setting up website authentication.

:::

To enable security, follow the steps below to use IIS and the Visual KPI Server Manager:

- [**Step 1: Decouple parent inheritance in IIS**](#step-1-decouple-parent-inheritance-in-iis)
- [**Step 2: Enable security in IIS Manager**](#step-2-enable-security-in-iis-manager)
- [**Step 3: Determine who gets access to websites**](#step-3-determine-who-gets-access-to-websites)
- [**Step 4: Set up rights assignment**](#step-4-set-up-rights-assignment)

## Step 1: Decouple parent inheritance in IIS

To set security for each component of Virtual KPI separately, you need to decouple directory inheritance from the Visual KPI website parent directory so that the Interface and WebService (for the Visual KPI Designer) won't inherit the same security as the Visual KPI website.

Use IIS Manager to decouple inheritance from the parent directory. You'll need to do this for each component:
- **Interfaces** (data sources)
- **WebService** (Designer)
- **Visual KPI Server instance** (website)

  alt="Components"

At the parent level of each component:
1. Right-click and select **Edit Permissions**.
2. When the **Properties** panel opens, select the **Security** tab.
3. Click **Advanced**.

4. In **Advanced Security Settings**, on the **Permissions** tab, click **Disable inheritance**.

:::warning Different UI

The UI may be different for other versions of Microsoft Windows Server.

5. In the **Block Inheritance** panel, select **Convert inherited permission into explicit permissions on this object**.

/>

6. Click **OK**.

:::important Repeat for Each Component

After you finish, remeber to repeat this for each component.

## Step 2: Enable security in IIS Manager

For every Visual KPI website, use IIS Manager to turn off anonymous access on the Visual KPI website and WebServices (hosts Visual KPI Designer).

Before you set up security for Visual KPI Sites, Interfaces and the Visual KPI Designer, you must enable security in [Microsoft Internet Information Services (or IIS Manager for Windows)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/iis/manage/configuring-security/configuring-ssl-in-iis-manager). You'll need to do this for each virtual directory to which you want to edit permissions.

The most common security settings are for the Visual KPI website and Visual KPI Designer. Most users will only grant access to the Visual KPI Designer software to those who can access it, but you can also set up access through IIS. Most clients do not set security for Interfaces, but you can do it by following the steps outlined below.

:::note Previous Step

Before you start this process, you should complete [Step 1: Decouple parent inheritance in IIS](#step-1-decouple-parent-inheritance-in-iis).

:::

### Setting Open or Secure access

You can either allow open access to each server or set security, which requires users to authenticate with a username and password.

#### For open access:

1. In IIS Manager, click the virtual directory for which you want to set authentication.
2. Right-click **Authentication** in the Home panel and select **Open Feature** to open the Authentication panel.

<StylizedImage

3. Enable **Anonymous Authentication**.
4. Enable **Windows Authentication**.

  alt="Authentication"
/>

#### To set secure access:
1. In IIS Manager, click the virtual directory for which you want to set authentication.
2. Right-click **Authentication** in the Home panel and select **Open Feature** to open the Authentication panel.

3. Disable **Anonymous Authentication**.
4. Enable **Windows Authentication**.

  alt="Authentication"
/>

## Step 3: Determine who gets access to websites

Once you set security in IIS, you must determine who gets access. For example, you can set authentication for the entire website. This sets up who can get access, not who gets to see what.

Visual KPI Server Manager allows you to create local groups and users, making it easy to set up authentication in IIS.
1. Open Visual KPI Server Manager
2. Click **Tools** in the menu.
3. Select **Computer Management**.

<StylizedImage
  imgURL="img/setup-adm/security/enable-security/security-groups-1.png"
  alt="Computer Management"
/>

4. Under **Local Users and Groups**, you can have a separate folder for **Users** and **Groups**.

<StylizedImage
  imgURL="img/setup-adm/security/enable-security/security-groups-2.png"
  alt="Computer Management"
/>

5. Move users into groups, or create a new group.

### Create a New Group

1. Right-click in the **Groups** panel.
2. Click **New Group**.
3. Name the Group.
4. Click **Add** to add members to the Group.
5. Start typing a name and click **Check Name** to find and add users.
6. Click **Create** to create the Group.

<StylizedImage
  imgURL="img/setup-adm/security/enable-security/security-groups-3.png"
  alt="New Group"
/>

### Add Groups in IIS Manager

1. In IIS Manager, right-click the top level for the website.
2. Select **Edit Permissions**.
3. In the Permissions panel, click **Add** to add the new group. It will open the **Permissions Entry** panel.

<StylizedImage
  imgURL="img/setup-adm/security/enable-security/security-groups-4.png"
  alt="Edit Permissions"
/>

4. Click **Locations** and select the server where the group is located.

<StylizedImage
  imgURL="img/setup-adm/security/enable-security/security-groups-5.png"
  alt="Locations"
/>

5. Type the name of the group and click **OK**.
6. Select the permissions for the new group:
- Read & Execute
- List folder contents
- Read
7. Click **OK** to save new users.


## Step 4: Set up rights assignment

Once users get access to the website, what can they see? This is where you'll set up rights assignment or object-level inheritance for users or user groups in the Visual KPI Designer. https://www.transpara.com/knowledge-base/visual-kpi-object-level-security/

### Access Denial Messages

Any user without granted access to Visual KPI sites or virtual directories will see the following messages.

- Visual KPI sites: a simple 403 error page
- Visual KPI Designer: a modal dialog box telling the user they are forbidden to access the necessary Web services
