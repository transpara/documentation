You’ll use ODBC interfaces for connecting to a SQL database. Install and configure ODBC interfaces using Visual KPI Server Manager.

To use Visual KPI  with ODBC interfaces, you need to specify the connection parameters for your database and modify the SQL Scripts to reference the actual field names for SampleData, LookUp, Value, and lupd.

ODBC interfaces are made up of a Web service and two SQL scripts (GetCurrentData.sql and GetTrendData.sql). Each SQL script uses four fields, two of which are used in your KPIs:

- **LookUp**: The tag name.
- **Value**: The value associated with the tag name.

The other two fields are used to find the correct value:

- **SampleData**: The table name.
- **lupd**: The date/time the row was last updated.

:::caution
These are generic field names.

## How Visual KPI Reads Data with ODBC Interfaces

To display KPI values, the Visual KPI ODBC interface follows a simple process:

1. Read the tag name associated with a specific KPI column (such as _Value_, _Target_, _Low_, etc.).
2. Search the _SampleData_ table for a row that has the same name in the _LookUp_ column. 
3. Retrieve the value in the same row.
4. Return the retrieved value to Visual KPI.

This way, the interface ensures that the KPI values displayed are accurate and reliable.

## Configuration

The ODBC interface comes with three queries, including an optional one, that require configuration. Upon installation of an ODBC interface, an example queries are automatically added. You'll need to edit these queries to fit your requirements. 

:::training
Refer to **[Visual KPI training](https://www.transpara.com/lesson/creating-odbc-interfaces-sql-2/)** to learn all about how Visual KPI interfaces reads from thousands of data sources and how to create your own interfaces.
:::

After installing a new ODBC interface following these [instructions](/docs/setup-and-administration/interfaces/configuration), you are ready to configure your interface by adding the following queries:

- [Get Current Value](#get-current-value-query)
- [Get Historical Value](#get-historical-value-query)
- [Get Trend Data](#get-trend-data-query)

:::info
Visual KPI gives you the power to parameterize most data allowing you to create one interface to query for different data. To learn more about it, refer to the [Parameterizing Interfaces](/docs/setup-and-administration/interfaces/parameterizing) page.

### Get Current Value Query

To retrieve the current value of what you're looking for, you need to run a specific query that returns one row with two columns named Value and Date. Any additional columns or rows will be disregarded. 

For instance, if you want to select a KPI value called DownloadPIR for a specific provider identified as Identifier, you can use this method:

```sql
  SELECT sum(DownloadPIR) AS Value,
  GetDate() AS Date
  FROM YOURTABLE
  WHERE Identifier = 'ENP001005';
```

:::tip
If this table or query has an actual timestamp column, you can also return that instead of GetDate.
:::

### Get Historical Value Query

The Get Historical Value Query is similar to the Get Current Value Query, however, it requires an additional parameter called `{TIMESTAMP}`. This query should return one row with two columns, namely Value and Date. The purpose of this query is to retrieve the Value at or before a given timestamp.

```sql
  SELECT sum(DownloadPIR) AS Value,
  SomeTimeColumn AS Date
  FROM YOURTABLE
  WHERE Identifier = 'ENP001005' AND Beam = 'Beam2'
  AND SomeTimeColumn={TIMESTAMP};
```

Where `TIMESTAMP` is a [parameter](/docs/setup-and-administration/interfaces/parameterizing) that will be replaced with an actual timestamp when configuring in Visual KPI Designer when using this query.

### Get Trend Data Query

To display the trend of a KPI, the ODBC interface of Visual KPI reads the tag name associated with a particular KPI column, such as Value, Target, Low, etc. Then, it searches the SampleData table for each row with the same tag name in the LookUp column and where the lupd (timestamp) falls within the correct time range. The time range is based on the current Trend Range in Visual KPI. Once the search is complete, the interface retrieves the Value and lupd (timestamp) from the same row and returns them to Visual KPI, which draws the trend graph.

```sql
  SELECT sum(DownloadPIR) AS Value,
  SomeTimeColumn AS Date
  FROM YOURTABLE
  WHERE Identifier = 'ENP001005' AND Beam = 'Beam2'
  AND Date BETWEEN {STARTDATE} and {ENDDATE} 
  ORDER BY Date;
```

In the query above, `STARTDATE` and `ENDDATE` are [parameters](/docs/setup-and-administration/interfaces/parameterizing) that will be replaced with actual timestamps when configuring in Visual KPI Designer to create a time range for the trend data.

:::caution
When calculating a sum, it's important to determine whether it's daily, hourly, or weekly. To handle this logic using a start and end date, you should create a query that takes these factors into account. For instance, if you request a year's worth of data, your query should sum the data on a daily basis, resulting in 365 values, one for each day. To accomplish this, you could create a parameter that allows you to choose between Daily, Hourly, and Weekly, and then use SQL logic to perform the calculation accurately.

## Aggregate Raw Data with ODBC Interface

ODBC Aggregation Settings can be used in conjunction with an ODBC interface to perform mathematical operations on the data returned by the interface. Instead of delivering raw data, Visual KPI can aggregate the queried data based on the parameters specified by you. The raw data is first queried via the interface, then aggregated according to your settings, and finally returned to your Visual KPI site.

This feature can be useful if you prefer not to write queries in Visual KPI Designer. Aggregation Settings enables Visual KPI to perform calculations on the server side. However, you can still write queries in Visual KPI Designer and customize them to your liking.

### Aggregation Setting

Aggregation Setting has three entities:

- **Aggregation Type**: Tells Visual KPI what type of function to perform on the returned data.
- **Bucket Duration**: Sets the time duration of the data returned.
- **Bucket Duration Unit**: Set the unit of time for the duration.

You can opt for an aggregation type of average with a duration of 30 minutes, for example. By doing so, Visual KPI will return one value that averages all the raw data collected over a 30-minute period. This way, instead of receiving raw data every few seconds, you receive a single value every 30 minutes that represents the data gathered during that duration.

## Stored Procedures

You can use stored procedures (sprocs) and reference them in Visual KPI Server Manager. You’ll need to return the same parameters for each query type, along with the named sproc.

- **Get Current Value**: `exec MyCurrentValueSproc {0}`

- **Get Historical Value**: `exec MyHistoricalValueSproc {0}, {TIMESTAMP}`

- **Get Trend Data**: `exec MyTrendDataSproc {0}, {STARTDATE}, {ENDDATE}`
