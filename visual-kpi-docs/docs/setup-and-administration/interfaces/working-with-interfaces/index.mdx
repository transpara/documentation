In Visual KPI, there are interfaces that require further configuration after installed. These are customizable interfaces that allow you to connect to data sources such as a restful API, any SQL database, and others. Also you can learn, in this section, how to parameterize your queries for these interfaces to make them even more flexible.

## Interfaces

Learn how to configure each of the following interfaces:

<LinkCards data={
  [
    {
      logo: 'ODBC',
      name: 'ODBC Interface',
      linkTo: '/docs/setup-and-administration/interfaces/odbc'
    },
    {
      logo: 'JSON',
      name: 'JSON Interface',
      linkTo: '/docs/setup-and-administration/interfaces/json'
    },
    {
      logo: 'python',
      name: 'Python Interface',
      linkTo: '/docs/setup-and-administration/interfaces/python'
    },
    {
      logo: 'tStore',
      name: 'tStore Interface',
      linkTo: '/docs/setup-and-administration/interfaces/t-store'
    }
  ]
}/>

## Parameterizing

To learn how to parameterize your queries while configuring your interfaces, refer to the following page:

<LinkCards data={
  [
    {
      name: 'Parameterizing',
      linkTo: '/docs/setup-and-administration/interfaces/Parameterizing'
    }
  ]
}/>
