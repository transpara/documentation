When you start, visual KPI Designer is already set up with basic configuration. However, setting the branding and details for your site takes only a few minutes. In addition, you can quickly add a few KPIs and have your website ready.

Of course, there are many configurations you can control using the Visual KPI Designer. However, this page will help you make the basic configurations and explain available features.

## Contextual help

In the Visual KPI Designer, each worksheet includes headers that indicate the data to be entered in a cell. Click in any header cell to see a tooltip with an explanation of the data in that column.

In addition, some configuration worksheets have **Description** columns to add context to the current parameter. It tells you exactly what that item means and helps you know what kind of value to enter. For example, in the **Website Configuration** worksheet, the description for Site Title tells you that whatever you enter here will show up in the title bar on the website.
