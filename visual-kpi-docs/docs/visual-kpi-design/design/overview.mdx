Visual KPI Designer runs inside Microsoft Excel as an addin and its tools are separated into sections that allow you to take several types of actions. You'll notice the object types in the Visual KPI Designer correlate to the tabs in the Visual KPI site navigation bar:

- [Groups](/docs/visual-kpi-design/design/groups)
- [KPIs](/docs/visual-kpi-design/design/kpis)
- [Charts](/docs/visual-kpi-design/design/charts)
- [Tables](/docs/visual-kpi-design/design/tables)

These are called objects in Visual KPI. You'll use these object types in the Visual KPI Designer to configure data for each of those objects as they appear in your Visual KPI sites.

As you click each object type in the Visual KPI Designer, the object toolbar below interacts with only the selected object. Use the object types and object toolbar to configure your Visual KPI sites.

Each object type opens a new worksheet in the Visual KPI Designer. For example, if you are on a KPI worksheet and click Charts to add a new chart, a new worksheet opens called Charts. As you select the object types, the object toolbar changes, depending on what tools you need to configure that object.

In this section, you will learn how to configure each one of those objects, so you can build your own Visual KPI site.
