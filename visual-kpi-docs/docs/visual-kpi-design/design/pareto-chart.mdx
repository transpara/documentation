Pareto charts can help you quickly see which of your assets are most critical and know where you need to focus. You could configure Pareto charts for quality control, showing where most of the problems are coming from. For example, if you create a Pareto chart for Plant Yield, you could quickly see which plant is causing your overall numbers to fall.

Pareto charts show assets and values in the bars and use a line to show cumulative effect.

## Define Pareto Chart Attributes

After you have created and configured some basic attributes for a  Pareto chart, such as the name, description and display order, you can begin to describe the data that will build the chart. Here, we show you the basic attributes that you need to set in order design a basic Pareto chart. To see all of the possible attributes you can configure, see [Charts Attributes & Keywords Reference Guide](/docs/visual-kpi-design/reference-tables/charts-reference).

### Name X and Y Axes

Name the X and Y axis, as these labels will appear on the chart to identify the data represented.

### Create & Name Bars

You can add up to 20 bars to your Pareto chart. Give a label to each bar.

### Enter Values and/or Interface

To add data to your chart, you add a value, calculation and/or interface for each bar. You can also add Connect Strings.

### Select Bar Colors

You can select the color for each bar, or leave the attribute blank and Visual KPI will select default colors.
